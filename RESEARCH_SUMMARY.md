  - Citation: https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2023.1142663/full

- **2024 Meta-Analysis** (Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation): 29 studies, 1,561 stroke patients

- **2024 Systematic Review** (PMC): Comprehensive review of immersive VR for unilateral spatial neglect
  - Citation: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9688364/

### Key Mechanisms

1. **Multimodal sensory stimulation**: VR provides rich, controlled sensory environments
2. **Ecological validity**: Real-world simulation improves transfer of learning
3. **Precise stimulus control**: Objective measurement of performance
4. **Immersion & presence**: Enhanced engagement vs. traditional therapy

### Clinical Outcomes

- Patients demonstrate improved orientation to contralesional (neglected) side
- Reduction in attentional deficits for auditory, visual, and somatosensory stimuli
- Benefits persist beyond training sessions (neuroplastic changes)

## 2. EEG Neurofeedback for Hemispatial Neglect

### Evidence Base ✅ Very Promising

**Breakthrough Study** (Neural Plasticity, 2017):
- **Title**: "Increased Alpha-Rhythm Dynamic Range Promotes Recovery from Visuospatial Neglect: A Neurofeedback Study"
- **Citation**: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2017/7407241
- **PubMed**: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28529806/

**Study Design**:
- 5 right-hemisphere stroke patients with visuospatial neglect
- EEG neurofeedback targeting right posterior parietal cortex (rPPC)
- Training goal: Reduce alpha oscillations from rPPC
- Protocol: 20 minutes/day for 6 days

**Results**:
- ✅ Patients successfully learned neurofeedback regulation between sessions
- ✅ Improved control of alpha oscillations from rPPC
- ✅ First demonstration of EEG-NFB feasibility in neglect patients
- ✅ Supports "reinstatement of intact parietal alpha oscillations" as therapeutic target

### Neurophysiological Mechanisms

**Alpha Oscillations** (8-12 Hz):
- Excessive alpha in right parietal cortex correlates with neglect severity
- Alpha desynchronization (reduction) = cortical activation
- Training to reduce alpha → enhanced attention to contralesional space

**Beta Activity** (13-30 Hz):
- Beta correlates with alertness and sustained attention
- Neglect patients show reduced beta activity
- Recovery associates with enhanced beta activity
- Beta/theta ratio training shows promise (validated in ADHD, applicable to neglect)

**Target Brain Region**:
- Right posterior parietal cortex (rPPC)
- Critical for spatial attention and awareness
- Damaged in many stroke patients with neglect
- Accessible via Muse TP10 electrode placement

### Supporting Research

- **Network connectivity studies** (MIT Press, 2022): EEG in stroke patients with neglect shows:
  - Focal frequency slowing in right posterior regions
  - Delta/theta power increases
  - Alpha/beta/gamma decreases

2. **Personalized adaptation**: System adjusts to individual brain patterns
3. **Enhanced neuroplasticity**: Active engagement promotes brain reorganization
4. **Objective measurement**: Quantifiable progress tracking

**Applications** (PMC, 2023):
- Motor rehabilitation (most common)
- Cognitive impairment recovery
- Attention training (directly applicable to neglect)
- Memory disorders

## Synthesis: NeglectFix V0 Design

### Theoretical Framework

**Combining validated approaches**:

1. ✅ VR visual exploration (validated for neglect)
2. ✅ EEG neurofeedback (alpha/beta training validated for neglect)
3. ✅ Closed-loop BCI (validated for stroke rehabilitation)

**Novel contribution**: Integrating all three specifically for hemispatial neglect + hemianopia

### Evidence-Based Protocol

**Neurofeedback Target** (from Ros et al., 2017):
- Brain region: Right posterior parietal cortex (Muse TP10)
- Primary goal: ↓ Reduce alpha power (8-12 Hz) during attention tasks
- Secondary goal: ↑ Increase beta power (13-30 Hz) for alertness
- Monitor: Theta (4-8 Hz) as alertness indicator

**Training Schedule** (from literature):
- Duration: 20 minutes per session
- Frequency: Daily (or every other day)
- Minimum course: 6 sessions (extendable to 6+ weeks)

**VR Tasks** (from VR-VET protocols):
- Visual exploration of left space
- Search tasks with left-side targets
- Everyday environments (kitchen, living room)
- Audio-visual cues drawing attention leftward

**Closed-Loop Mechanism**:
```
EEG Input (TP10) → Alpha↓ + Beta↑ = Attention engaged
        +
Head Tracking → Looking left = Scanning left space
        ↓
VR Reward → Brighten/animate left environment
        ↓
Reinforcement → Strengthens left-attention neural pattern
```

## Safety & Limitations

### Safety Considerations

✅ **Non-invasive**: All methods are surface EEG and VR (no implants, no TMS)
✅ **Evidence-based**: Each component individually validated
✅ **Consumer hardware**: Muse and Quest 2 are FDA-approved consumer devices
✅ **Home-based**: Telerehabilitation feasibility demonstrated

⚠️ **Considerations**:
- VR can cause motion sickness (start with short sessions)
- EEG requires consistent electrode contact (follow Muse fitting guide)
- Individual variability in neurofeedback learning (some learn faster than others)

### Limitations

**Research gaps**:
- No published studies specifically combining VR + EEG for neglect (this is novel!)
- Most neglect neurofeedback studies have small sample sizes (n=5-10)
- Consumer EEG (Muse) lower quality than medical-grade systems

**V0 Approach**:
- Treat as experimental personal research tool
- Systematic data logging for self-tracking
- Iterate based on subjective + objective outcomes
- Not a replacement for professional therapy
