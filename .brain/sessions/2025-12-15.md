# Session: December 15, 2025

## Summary
Fixed critical hemifield positioning bug and obtained first validated baseline measurement of contrast sensitivity across all three visual fields.

---

## What Was Done

### Bug Fix: Hemifield Positioning
- **Problem**: Letters were ALWAYS displayed at screen center regardless of hemifield mode
- **Cause**: UI `anchoredPosition` was hardcoded to `Vector2.zero`, overriding any hemifield offset
- **Impact**: Previous tests were NOT actually testing peripheral vision - all used central vision
- **Solution**: Added `GetHemifieldUIOffset()` function to apply proper left/right positioning

### New Features Added
- Red fixation cross (+) appears during hemifield tests
- Hemifield indicator in console logs: `[Central]`, `[LeftHemifield]`, `[RightHemifield]`
- `hemifieldUIOffset` parameter (300px default) for visual field positioning

### First Baseline Measurement
Completed full test sequence: Central → Right → Left

| Visual Field | LogCS | Contrast | Result |
|--------------|-------|----------|--------|
| Central | ~1.05+ | ~9% | Good |
| Right (intact) | **2.25** | 0.6% | Maxed test |
| Left (affected) | **0.00** | 100% | Total failure |

**Asymmetry: 2.25 LogCS** (clinically significant is ≥0.30)

## Key Learnings

1. Always verify positioning by checking console logs for hemifield indicator
2. UI RectTransform and 3D Transform are separate positioning systems
3. Mac "Delete" key = Backspace in Unity for "can't see" response

---

## Files Changed
- `Assets/Scripts/Assessment/ContrastSensitivityTest.cs` - Hemifield positioning fix, fixation cross
- `Assets/Scripts/Assessment/ContrastTestInput.cs` - Input handling
- `Assets/ContrastTestScene.unity` - Scene updates
- `CLAUDE.md` - Created with project context

---

## Git
- Commit: `cddc43c`
- Message: "Fix hemifield positioning - First validated baseline measurement"
- Pushed to: `origin/main`

---

## Next Session
- Consider implementing audiovisual training module
- Weekly re-assessment to track progress from baseline
- Potential Quest deployment for immersive testing

## Today's Story

**The Invisible Bug**

For days, I thought I was doing great on the contrast test - reading letters down to very faint contrasts. But something felt off. Why was my "damaged" left visual field performing just as well as my right?

Turns out, the test was lying to me. A bug in the code meant every letter was appearing dead center, right where my vision is still good. I wasn't testing my blind side at all.

**The Fix That Revealed The Truth**

Once we fixed the positioning so letters actually appear in my peripheral vision, the reality hit hard:

- **Right side (healthy)**: I could see letters down to 0.6% contrast - nearly invisible to most people. Score: 2.25
- **Left side (damaged)**: I couldn't see a single letter. Not even pure black on gray. Score: 0.00

That's not a small difference. That's everything versus nothing.

**Why This Matters**

Now I have a real number. A starting point. 0.00 on the left.

The research says audiovisual training can improve contrast sensitivity by 0.31 to 0.54 points. My goal is to move that zero. Any improvement means my brain is rewiring, finding new pathways around the damaged area.

**What I Learned**

Keep your eyes on the red cross. Don't chase the letters - that's cheating. The whole point is to see what your peripheral vision can detect while looking straight ahead.
