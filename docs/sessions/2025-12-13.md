# Session: 2025-12-13

## Topic: Contrast Sensitivity Test - First Working Version

### Context
Continuation from 2025-12-12. Goal was to get the Contrast Sensitivity Assessment module running in Unity and test it.

### Accomplished

1. **Unity Project Setup**:
   - Successfully opened Unity project in Unity 6.2 (6000.2.8f1)
   - Resolved Safe Mode compilation errors
   - Fixed missing SDK dependencies with preprocessor directives (`#if OVR_INSTALLED`, `#if EXTOSC_INSTALLED`)
   - Changed Input System to "Both" (old + new) in Player Settings

2. **Scene Setup (ContrastTestScene)**:
   - Created Canvas with TextMeshPro UI elements
   - Wired LetterDisplay and InstructionsText to ContrastSensitivityTest script
   - Added ContrastTestManager with both test scripts

3. **Bug Fixes**:
   - Fixed input timing bug in `StartFullTestSequence()` - Space key was being detected twice
   - Fixed keyboard input for letter keys - changed from char casting to explicit KeyCode mapping
   - Fixed letter visibility - letters were overlapping with instructions
   - Repositioned UI elements programmatically during test

4. **Contrast Calibration**:
   - Initial implementation was too easy (letters stayed visible throughout)
   - Changed from luminance-based contrast to **alpha transparency** approach
   - Final working formula: `alpha = contrast * 3` where contrast = 10^(-LogCS)
   - Adjusted starting LogCS from 0.0 to 0.5 (31% contrast start)
   - Test now properly fades letters to invisibility

### Test Results (Eric's First Run)

- **Central Vision**: Struggled at LogCS ~1.95, lost at LogCS ~2.10
- This indicates contrast sensitivity threshold around **1.95 LogCS**
- Normal range for age 52: ~1.80-1.90 LogCS
- Results seem high - calibration may need refinement

### Key Code Changes

**ContrastSensitivityTest.cs**:
- `GetLetterColor()` now uses alpha transparency instead of luminance
- Added UI repositioning in `ShowNextLetter()`
- Starting LogCS changed to 0.5
- Debug logging for contrast values

**ContrastTestInput.cs**:
- Replaced char-to-KeyCode casting with explicit KeyCode checks
- Added `TryRespondWithLetter()` helper with debug logging

**MuseOSCReceiver.cs**:
- Wrapped extOSC code in `#if EXTOSC_INSTALLED` preprocessor directives

### Current State

**Working**:
- Full test sequence (Central → Right → Left hemifields)
- Letter display with progressive transparency
- Keyboard input (C, D, H, K, N, O, R, S, V, Z)
- Backspace for "can't see" response
- Console logging of all trials

**Needs Work**:
- Contrast calibration may need adjustment (test feels too easy initially)
- Results display UI not yet implemented
- CSV logging not yet tested
- VR controller input (requires Meta XR SDK)

### Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `Assessment/ContrastSensitivityTest.cs` | UI positioning, alpha-based contrast, timing fixes |
| `Assessment/ContrastTestInput.cs` | KeyCode fixes, debug logging |
| `EEG/MuseOSCReceiver.cs` | Preprocessor directives for extOSC |
| `.gitignore` | Updated patterns for Unity subfolder structure |

### Next Steps

1. **Calibration refinement**: Adjust contrast curve to better match clinical Pelli-Robson
2. **Test hemifield differences**: Run full 3-hemifield test to measure asymmetry
3. **Results UI**: Display final scores with interpretation
4. **CSV logging**: Test DataLogger integration
5. **VR deployment**: Install Meta XR SDK, test on Quest

### Notes

- Unity's skybox background makes luminance-based contrast unreliable
- Alpha transparency approach works well regardless of background
- Eric's contrast sensitivity seems good for central vision - the interesting test will be Left vs Right hemifield comparison

## Session 2: Unity MCP Integration (Major Milestone!)

### Context
Eric discovered Unity MCP - a bridge allowing Claude Code to directly interact with Unity Editor. This is game-changing for accessibility since Eric is visually impaired and struggles with the Unity Editor interface.

### What We Set Up

**CoplayDev/unity-mcp** (3.6k stars, MIT license)
- Python-based MCP server
- Auto-Setup feature for Claude Code
- Active maintenance and good documentation

### Installation Steps Completed

1. **Installed uv package manager**:
   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   # Installed uv 0.9.17
   ```

2. **Installed unity-mcp Unity package**:
   - Package Manager → Add package from git URL
   - URL: `https://github.com/CoplayDev/unity-mcp.git?path=/MCPForUnity`

3. **Registered MCP server with Claude Code**:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add --transport stdio UnityMCP -- "/Users/ericlespagnon/.local/bin/uvx" --from "git+https://github.com/CoplayDev/unity-mcp@v8.2.3#subdirectory=Server" mcp-for-unity
   ```

4. **Started Unity MCP session**:
   - Window → MCP For Unity → Toggle MCP Window
   - Transport: Stdio
   - Click "Start Session" → Green indicator

### What Claude Code Can Now Do

| Capability | Tool | Example |
|------------|------|---------|
| Read scene hierarchy | `manage_scene` | See all GameObjects and their properties |
| Create/modify GameObjects | `manage_gameobject` | Add objects, components, set transforms |
| Write C# scripts | `manage_script` | Create and edit scripts directly |
| Manage materials | `manage_material` | Create materials, set shaders |
| Read console | `read_console` | See errors, warnings, logs |
| Execute menu items | `execute_menu_item` | Run any Unity menu command |

### Verified Working

Successfully read ContrastTestScene hierarchy:
- Main Camera
- Directional Light
- Global Volume
- EEG System
- ContrastTest
- Canvas (with LetterDisplay, InstructionsText)
- EventSystem
- ContrastTestManager

Also detected 5 deprecation warnings in console (FindObjectOfType → FindFirstObjectByType).

### Impact

**Before**: Eric had to describe what he wanted, Claude would generate code, Eric would manually navigate Unity to implement it - slow and error-prone.

**After**: Claude is Eric's "eyes and hands" inside Unity. Can directly create scenes, add objects, write scripts, and verify everything works.

### How to Start Future Sessions

1. **Open Unity** with NegletFix project
2. **Start MCP session**: Window → MCP For Unity → Toggle MCP Window → Start Session (green = connected)
3. **Start Claude Code** in the NegletFix directory
4. Claude automatically has Unity access via the registered MCP server

### Files Changed

- None (all configuration via CLI and Unity Editor)

### MCP Registration Info

To manage the Unity MCP server:
```bash
# List servers
claude mcp list

# Remove if needed
claude mcp remove UnityMCP

# Re-add
claude mcp add --transport stdio UnityMCP -- "/Users/ericlespagnon/.local/bin/uvx" --from "git+https://github.com/CoplayDev/unity-mcp@v8.2.3#subdirectory=Server" mcp-for-unity
```
