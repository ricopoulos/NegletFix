# Session: 2024-12-05

## Topic: Documentation Workflow Setup

### Context
Eric wanted to bridge the gap between brainstorming sessions (Claude chat) and implementation sessions (Claude Code). Currently, context from research discussions wasn't flowing to the dev environment.

### Decided

1. **Created `/docs` folder structure** in repo:
   - `/docs/CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md` - Master brief Claude Code reads first
   - `/docs/research/` - Scientific findings, clinical protocols
   - `/docs/decisions/` - Architecture and design decisions  
   - `/docs/sessions/` - Brainstorming session summaries (like this one)

2. **Workflow established**:
   - Brainstorm in Claude chat (phone/desktop)
   - Produce session notes at end
   - Commit to repo
   - Claude Code reads for implementation context

3. **Claude Code will be instructed** to:
   - Read `CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md` at start of sessions
   - Check `/docs/sessions/` for recent context
   - Update documentation when making significant decisions

### Discussion Notes

Eric reflected on the therapeutic value of understanding the medical/neurological details of his stroke during our research sessions. The deep dives into PCA territory, SC pathways, and multisensory integration provided both technical foundation AND personal processing that his neurologist didn't facilitate.

Key insight: Understanding the mechanics transforms the experience from "mysterious thing that happened to me" into something that can be intellectually held and acted upon.

### Open Questions
- None for this session

### Next Implementation Steps
1. Commit `/docs` folder to repo
2. Run the Claude Code initialization prompt (see `CLAUDE_CODE_INIT.md`)
3. Continue V1 audiovisual system implementation with new context flow
