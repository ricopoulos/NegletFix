# Scientific Foundation: Cross-Modal Rehabilitation

## Core Principle

**Spatiotemporally congruent audiovisual stimulation activates the preserved superior colliculus pathway, producing supra-additive neural responses that can restore visual detection in the blind field.**

## Why This Works in Hemianopia

### The Damaged Pathway
In hemianopia from occipital stroke, the primary visual pathway is damaged:
```
Retina → Lateral Geniculate Nucleus → V1 (damaged) → Conscious vision
```

### The Preserved Pathway
The retino-collicular pathway remains intact:
```
Retina → Superior Colliculus → Extrastriate cortex → Detection/Orienting
```

More than 70% of SC neurons projecting to brainstem motor centers respond to multisensory stimulation.

## Three Principles of Multisensory Integration

From Stein & Meredith (1993), "The Merging of the Senses":

1. **Spatial Principle**: Stimuli at the same location produce enhanced responses; spatially disparate stimuli may depress responses.

2. **Temporal Principle**: Stimuli must occur within ~100-500ms window for binding.

3. **Inverse Effectiveness**: Greater enhancement when individual signals are weak - exactly the situation in the blind field where residual visual input exists but falls below detection threshold.

## Clinical Evidence

### Frontiers 2021 VR Study (Daibert-Nido et al.)
- DOI: 10.3389/fneur.2021.680211
- **Total training time**: Under 5 hours (20 sessions × 15 min)
- **Results**: 
  - Contrast sensitivity: +0.31 to +0.54 logits
  - Visual field: +7-9 points Humphrey (in blind hemifield)
  - Reading speed: +10-22%

### Wake Forest Protocol (Rowland & Stein)
- Trials: NCT04963075, NCT05894434, IRB00061542
- **Parameters**: 500ms stimuli, 45° eccentricity, 600 trials/session
- **Results**: Recovery began within 3-5 sessions

## Relevance to Eric's Case

**Diagnosis**: Right PCA stroke with hemorrhagic transformation → Left homonymous hemianopia

**Target symptom**: "Gray overlay" - bilateral dimness perception

**Hypothesis**: The gray overlay may reflect disrupted gain control in visual processing. Cross-modal training via SC pathway could:
1. Amplify weak visual signals through multisensory enhancement
2. Strengthen SC→extrastriate feedback connections
3. Improve overall contrast/brightness perception
